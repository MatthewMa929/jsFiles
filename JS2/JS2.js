/* JS2
Create a conditional statement that compares two numbers. 
You can choose if those numbers will be equal, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, 
or greater than or equal to each other. Include an if, else if, and else statement. 
Create an alert that gives your user feedback based on the number. 
Test your statement with different numbers to make sure all alerts work.*/

var num1 = 0;
var num2 = 1;

if (num1 == num2) {
	alert("num1 and num2 are the same number");
}
else if (num1 > num2) {
	alert("num1 is greater than num2");
}
else {
	alert("num1 is less than num2");
}
